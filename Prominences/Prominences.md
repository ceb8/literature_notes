**Main finding:** Radio images of AB Dor show emission spots up tp 5-18 *R<sub>\*</sub>*. Several theories for what these could be are discussed.  
**Our goal:** Determine if these structures could be stellar prominences

**About AB Dor**
- AB Dor is a fast-rotating pre-main sequence star.  
 (Table 1 holds stellar properties)  
 - It is very active and well-studied (basically household name). 
 - About 15 pc away.

**Background**  
Previous **very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)** studies of other pre-main sequence starts have shown resolved magnetospheres with sizes of several stellar radii. These results combined with spectra and polarization measurements were used to create a global dipole-like magnetosphere model. The radio emission is is believed to be from (gyro)synchrotron radiation, which would mean that most of the radio emission originated in some combination of: 1) the magnetic equator line, at the distance where the stellar wind opens the closed magentic field lines 2) close to the polar caps where the wind is unrestrained. So basically this is saying that the radio emission come from free flowing stellar wind.

**Technical details**
- 1.4 GHz (21 cm)  
  8.4 GHz  
  22.3 GHZ (1.3 cm)  
  Table 2 has details
- Inclination of rotation axis of 60° to our line of sight

**Findings**
- At 8.4 GHz the brightest peak of emission is coincident with the position of the star.  
  The images show complex structures around star, with two distinct emission peaks.
- At 1.4 GHz AB Dor is compact source at expected position
- At 22.3 GHz AB Dor shows nothing at the expected position, but an extended source ~17.5 R* away.  
  Because of low S/N validity of this detection is somewha suspect  
  If detection is real, origin is unknown  
  
- Split 8.4 GHz into snapshots a few hours long, shows significant morphological variation on this timescale

- Possible explanations  
  (gyro)synchrotron emission from large-scale magnetic structures  
  interacting magnetospheres (With AB Dor C) form "helmet streamers"  
  Slongshot prominences  
- 8.4 GHz models must account for:  
  internal structure with compact features at 10/18 R* away from central component  
  variability of componant positions on timescale of hours  
  low degree of circular polarization  
  brightness temps between 10^7 and 10^8 K 

**Possible scenarios**
- Polar cap model  
  Emission comes from abover polar region of star
  Rotation axis east-west wrt the viewer, slightly misaligned magnetic axis wrt the rotation axis  
  Does explain the observational features

- Flaring loop model  
  Emmision originates due to magnetic reconnection of coronal loop sructure following magnetic field lines  
  Nearly noth-south rotation axis, slightly misaligned magnetic axis wrt the rotation axis  
  Recconnection events ~5-9 R*  
  Fits the snapshopts, but does not explain western-mostr componant being the brighted one (necessarily)

- Helmet streamer model  
  radio emission originates at upper and lower mirror points
  associated with large and continuously produced slingshot prominences
  explains most of the observations, except for the preferred eastwards orientation of the radio emission  
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9406508/154261536-4912b4ca-4adc-44bb-a52e-e927e9a58b13.png" width="350"/>

- Close companion scenario  
  This model would easily explain the features, but is incompatible with previous measurements of the AB Dor system


**Conclusion**
Results confirm extraordinary coronal magnetic activity in AB Dor, producing compact radio structures at large heights previously only seen in interacting binaries.  
No emission found at expected position of AB Dor C (ultracool dwarf) which puts upper limits on it.
