- Sun rotates too slowly to have centrifugally-supported slingshot prominences (i.e. above co-rotation radius)
- They use rotation evolution code (simulation software) to derive properties of the formation/ejection of prominences in sun-like stars
- **Finding:** for stars with initial rotation rate > 4.6 time solar rotation rate, slingshot prominences will be present even after it reachest the main sequence  
  Also, the mass/lifetime of these slingshot prominences have max values when the star reaches the zero-age main sequence
- References to lots of papers with specific prominence discoveries (in intro)
- The alfven radius (r_A) and keplerian co-rotation radius (r_K) are dependent on the stellar rotation rate and will change as the star evolves
- This work investigates the time-span for which slingshot prominences may exist on a solar-like star: 
  - How long <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r_K < r_A">
  - How mass, mass-loss rate, and lifetime of ejection of the prominence evolve
- Use the rotation evolution code to translate rotation rate dependency into time dependency

- A star;s coronl magnetic field structure is a fundamental propery that governs high-enrgy coronal emissio and mass/angular momentum loss from the stellar wind
- This paper presents a new method to trace this structure in rapidly-rotating young convective stars using slingshot prominences
- They extrapolate the magnetic field structure of AB Dor from surface field map and make synthetic H-Œ± stacked spectra
- They do this with both a *potential* and *non-potential* field, and the  *potential* extrapolation matches the observations, while the *non-potential* one does not
- They conclude that ejected prominences carry away mass and angular momentum at widely varying rates, but which ay approach those carried by stellar wind

~ `\cite{Climent_2020A&A...641A..90C}` ~ :page_facing_up:

**Main finding:** Radio images of AB Dor show emission spots up tp 5-18 *R<sub>\*</sub>*. Several theories for what these could be are discussed.  
**Our goal:** Determine if these structures could be stellar prominences

**About AB Dor**
- AB Dor is a fast-rotating pre-main sequence star.  
 (Table 1 holds stellar properties)  
 - It is very active and well-studied (basically household name). 
 - About 15 pc away.

**Background**  
Previous **very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)** studies of other pre-main sequence starts have shown resolved magnetospheres with sizes of several stellar radii. These results combined with spectra and polarization measurements were used to create a global dipole-like magnetosphere model. The radio emission is is believed to be from (gyro)synchrotron radiation, which would mean that most of the radio emission originated in some combination of: 1) the magnetic equator line, at the distance where the stellar wind opens the closed magentic field lines 2) close to the polar caps where the wind is unrestrained. So basically this is saying that the radio emission come from free flowing stellar wind.

**Technical details**
- 1.4 GHz (21 cm)  
  8.4 GHz  
  22.3 GHZ (1.3 cm)  
  Table 2 has details
- Inclination of rotation axis of 60¬∞ to our line of sight

**Findings**
- At 8.4 GHz the brightest peak of emission is coincident with the position of the star.  
  The images show complex structures around star, with two distinct emission peaks.
- At 1.4 GHz AB Dor is compact source at expected position
- At 22.3 GHz AB Dor shows nothing at the expected position, but an extended source ~17.5 R* away.  
  Because of low S/N validity of this detection is somewha suspect  
  If detection is real, origin is unknown  
  
- Split 8.4 GHz into snapshots a few hours long, shows significant morphological variation on this timescale
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9406508/154256020-fe1352f0-1cca-48e5-9e25-d858b36f229d.png" height="350"/>

- Possible explanations  
  (gyro)synchrotron emission from large-scale magnetic structures  
  interacting magnetospheres (With AB Dor C) form "helmet streamers"  
  Slongshot prominences  
- 8.4 GHz models must account for:  
  internal structure with compact features at 10/18 R* away from central component  
  variability of componant positions on timescale of hours  
  low degree of circular polarization  
  brightness temps between 10^7 and 10^8 K 

**Possible scenarios**
- Polar cap model  
  Emission comes from abover polar region of star
  Rotation axis east-west wrt the viewer, slightly misaligned magnetic axis wrt the rotation axis  
  Does explain the observational features  
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9406508/154261328-d7ce4c01-71f0-4bb6-8e4a-9e7cfc00d2c4.png" height="300"/>

- Flaring loop model  
  Emmision originates due to magnetic reconnection of coronal loop sructure following magnetic field lines  
  Nearly noth-south rotation axis, slightly misaligned magnetic axis wrt the rotation axis  
  Recconnection events ~5-9 R*  
  Fits the snapshopts, but does not explain western-mostr componant being the brighted one (necessarily)  
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9406508/154261377-8358a5e3-5f9a-43fc-a57b-d96f46aeb70f.png" width="350"/>

- Helmet streamer model  
  radio emission originates at upper and lower mirror points
  associated with large and continuously produced slingshot prominences
  explains most of the observations, except for the preferred eastwards orientation of the radio emission  
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9406508/154261536-4912b4ca-4adc-44bb-a52e-e927e9a58b13.png" width="350"/>

- Close companion scenario  
  This model would easily explain the features, but is incompatible with previous measurements of the AB Dor system


**Conclusion**
Results confirm extraordinary coronal magnetic activity in AB Dor, producing compact radio structures at large heights previously only seen in interacting binaries.  
No emission found at expected position of AB Dor C (ultracool dwarf) which puts upper limits on it.

~ `\cite{CollierCameron_2001IAUS..203..229C}` ~ üìÑ

**Main points**
- Prominences seem to be in physical state similar to solar prominences inasmuch as they are cool enough and dense enough to contain substantial neutral hydrogen
- Prominences show great promise for probing extent and geometry of closed magnetic field lines in the coronae around rotating cool stars
- Prominence structure seems to evolve faster than surface stucture
- Evolution of prominences provides diagnostic on evolution of large-scale corona structure

**Intro**
- Coronal condensations = slingshot prominences = stellar prominences
- Prominences form as a variety of distances, but favor sites near Keplarian co-rotation radius
- Can be seen in Balmer absortion or (less often) emission
- Prominences are confined and supported byt he magnetic field, and insulated by poor cross-field thermal conductivity
- Spatial distribution of prominences give insight into coronal field topology, specifically serve as tracers for the radial extent and longitudinal structure of closed field lines
- Earliest observational evidence in pencil beam studies of exlipsing binaries (Schr√∂der 1983)

**Prominences on single stars**
- In single stars, observed via HŒ± absorption transients. 
- Cameron and Robinson (1989) used time resolved spectroscopy to infer HŒ± absorbing material co-rotating arounf AB Dor
- Drift rates of transients determine distances of prominences from rotation axis
- AB Dor: strong concentration near corotation surface (2.8 R* from rotation axis)
- Presense suggests formation mechanism similar to solar quiescent prominences
- Typical transient: column density <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=N_H \sim 10^{20} cm^{-2}">, temp <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=T \sim 8000-9000 K">, cross-sectional area <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=A \sim 3 \times 10^{21} cm^2">, meaning mass is 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than solar quiescent prominence.
- Typicall 6-8 prominences visible with cylindrical radii 2-8 R<sub>*</sub>
- Broadly consistent with solar quiesent prominences: cool material (8-9000 K) co-exists with material at both transition region and coronal temps, possibly in filamentary sub-structures

**Relation with magnetic field**
- Keplarian corotation radius favored, but sometimes prominences are found inside or substantially outside
- If prominence is significantly outside corotation radius, gravitational force on the plasma is not sufficient to maintain synchronous orbit, additional inward force is required. Camerion and Robinson (1989) proposed magnetic tension force due to curvature of magnetic field at summet of closed loop which anchor prominence to the stellar surface.
- In stable equilibrium spot capable of supporting a prominence, the effective gravity along local magnetic field must be zero, i.e. local graviotational-centrifugal potential minimum
- Prominence mass is supplied from surface via uplows, coriolis force on upflows may destabalize the loop unless the field is sufficiently strong, which is when prominences can form

- Mass loss rates for hot winds of cool stars are important for understanding the star's rotational evolution, but notoriously hard to measure.
- The paper presents a new mthod for measuring these mass loss rates for young rapid rotators using slingshot prominences.
- **Key insight:** the sonic point usually lies well below the condensation region. 
  This is saying is that the sonic radius is within the radius where the prominences are forming.  
  The sonic radius is where the plasma (which accelerates with distance) reaches the sound speed, so this defines if the flow is sub or super sonic when it reaches the prominence, if it's supersonic, information cannot travel back to the surface to adjust the density, so the density will just continue to grow until the max density that can be supported by the field will be exceeded.  
  When that happens with either fall back to the surface (prominence below co-rotation radius) or be centrifugally ejected (prominence above co-rotation radius)  
  We expect the ejected prominences to have max density possible because of this mechanism
- Because of the above, the the prominence does not affect the flow at the wind base (i.e. the surface)
- This means that masses and occurences of prominences can be used to estimate the mass flux in the wind  
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9406508/158469145-855cec16-1f71-4ecf-8566-162c9c3294d1.png" height="250"/>
- Their measurements extend the relationshpo between x-ray flux and mass loss rate to 5 orders of magnitude
- No evidence of seakening of mass loss rates with high x-ray flux levels
