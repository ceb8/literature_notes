- Looking at the magnetic field on eclipsing binary system V471 Tau (K2 dwarf, and hot white dwarf)
- They are looking into "eclipse timing variations" (ETVs) where the timing of the eclipse varies from what would be expected
- Proposal that the magnetically active  K2 dwarf is driving the ETVs, but need to monitor the star through it;s ~35 year activity cycle  
  (I think this 35 year cycle is for the system as a whole, where the below cycle is just for the K2 dwarf ‚ùì) 
- This work adds measurements from the ~max of stellar cycle to previous measurements (~13 years before) of min of stellar cycle
- They reconstruct the large scale magnetic field structure at the surface of the star:

- Analyzing H-Œ±, found a prominence with mass ~4x10^18 g, located further than Lagrange pt I 
- Evidence that a slingshot mechanism is likely cause the further away prominences

- Measured surface-average magnetic field on 292 M dwarfs. Most measurements are new.
- Found relation between magnetic field strength and Rossby number resembing the period-activity relation
- For slow moving stars magnetic flux is proportional to period
- For rapid rotators field strength is limited by availabl kinetic energy

- This work demonstrates that the rotaion-activity relation comes from a dependence by the magnetic dynamo on rotation
- "We advocate the picture that the magnetic dynamo generates magnetic flux on the stellar surface proportional to rotation rate with a saturation limit set by the available kinetic energy"

- They consider 4 types of x-ray and/or radio observations and see if they can be explained by a single magnetic source configuration
- They conclude that **yes** "dipole magnetic confinement" can explain all of the observations
- They believe this configuration is only likely on the most established stars
- Schematic of the configuration:

**Follow-up** üëÄ
- Ask Moira about the low density radio emission:  
This paper is just presenting a schematic based on the observations and a possible magnetic field, but no physical theory backing is, so we could be seeing this, but we would need to run our simulations and see what falls out. This particular scnario is not possibly for AB Dor based on its known angular inclination.
