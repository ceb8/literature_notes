- Looking at the magnetic field on eclipsing binary system V471 Tau (K2 dwarf, and hot white dwarf)
- They are looking into "eclipse timing variations" (ETVs) where the timing of the eclipse varies from what would be expected
- Proposal that the magnetically active  K2 dwarf is driving the ETVs, but need to monitor the star through it;s ~35 year activity cycle  
  (I think this 35 year cycle is for the system as a whole, where the below cycle is just for the K2 dwarf ‚ùì) 
- This work adds measurements from the ~max of stellar cycle to previous measurements (~13 years before) of min of stellar cycle
- They reconstruct the large scale magnetic field structure at the surface of the star:

- Analyzing H-Œ±, found a prominence with mass ~4x10^18 g, located further than Lagrange pt I 
- Evidence that a slingshot mechanism is likely cause the further away prominences
